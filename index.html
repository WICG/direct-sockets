        In order to communicate via TCP a socket connection must be requested first. The socket
        object constructor
        allows the site to specify the necessary parameters which control how data is transmitted
        and received.

        <pre class="js">
          const socket = new TCPSocket(/*remoteAddress=*/, /*remotePort=*/, /*options=*/);

        The developer should wait for the {{TCPSocket/opened}} promise to be resolved to gain access
        to {{TCPSocketOpenInfo/readable}} and {{TCPSocketOpenInfo/writable}} streams.

        <pre class="js">
          const { readable, writable } = await socket.opened;

        Once {{TCPSocket/opened}} has resolved, the {{TCPSocketOpenInfo/readable}} and
        {{TCPSocketOpenInfo/writable}}
        can be accessed to get the {{ReadableStream}} and {{WritableStream}} instances for receiving
        data from and sending data to the socket.

      <aside class="example">
        To write individual chunks of data to the socket a
        {{WritableStreamDefaultWriter}} can be created and released as necessary.
        This example uses a `TextEncoder` to encode a {{DOMString}} as the
        necessary {{Uint8Array}} for transmission.

        <pre class="js">
          const encoder = new TextEncoder();

          const { writable } = await socket.opened;

          await writer.write(encoder.encode("PING"));

        </pre>

        The {{WritableStreamDefaultWriter/write()}} method returns a {{Promise}} which
        resolves when data has been written. While having some data available in
        the transmit buffer is important to maintain good throughput awaiting this
        {{Promise}} before generating too many chunks of data is a good practice
        to avoid excessive buffering.

      <h3><dfn>close()</dfn> method</h3>

      <aside class="example">
        When communication with the port is no longer required it can be closed
        and the associated resources released by the system.

        <p>
          Calling `socket.`{{TCPSocket/close()}} implicitly invokes
          `opened.`{{TCPSocketOpenInfo/readable}}`.`{{ReadableStream/cancel()}} and
          `opened.`{{TCPSocketOpenInfo/writable}}`.`{{WritableStream/abort()}} in order to
          clear any buffered data. If the application has called
          `opened.`{{TCPSocketOpenInfo/readable}}`.`{{ReadableStream/getReader()}} or
          `opened.`{{TCPSocketOpenInfo/writable}}`.`{{WritableStream/getWriter()}} the stream
          is locked and the socket cannot be closed. This forces the developer to
          decide how to handle any read or write operations that are in progress.


          For example, to ensure that all buffered data has been transmitted before
          the socket is closed the application must await the {{Promise}} returned by
          `writer.`{{WritableStreamDefaultWriter/close()}}.

        <pre class="js">

          await writer.close();
          await socket.close();
        </pre>

        To discard any unsent data the application could instead call
        `writer.`{{WritableStreamDefaultWriter/abort()}}.

        If a loop is being used to read data from the socket, then it must be exited before calling
        `socket`.{{TCPSocket/close()}}.

          const reader = readable.getReader();

              const { value, done } = await reader.read();
              if (done) {
                // |reader| has been canceled.
                break;
              }
              // Do something with |value|...
            }

            await socket.close();
          }

          const read_complete = readUntilClosed();

        In order to communicate via UDP a socket must be opened first. The socket object constructor

      <aside class="example">
        To write individual chunks of data to the socket a
        {{WritableStreamDefaultWriter}} can be created and released as necessary.
        This example uses a `TextEncoder` to encode a {{DOMString}} as the
        necessary {{Uint8Array}} for transmission.

        <pre class="js">
          const encoder = new TextEncoder();

          const { writable } = await socket.opened;
          const writer = writable.getWriter();

          const message = {

          };

          await writer.write(message);

          writer.releaseLock();
        </pre>

        The {{WritableStreamDefaultWriter/write()}} method returns a {{Promise}} which
        resolves when data has been written. While having some data available in
        the transmit buffer is important to maintain good throughput awaiting this
        {{Promise}} before generating too many chunks of data is a good practice
        to avoid excessive buffering.

      <h3><dfn>close()</dfn> method</h3>

      <aside class="example">
        When communication with the port is no longer required it can be closed
        and the associated resources released by the system.

        <p>
          Calling `socket.`{{UDPSocket/close()}} implicitly invokes
          `opened.`{{UDPSocketOpenInfo/readable}}`.`{{ReadableStream/cancel()}} and
          `opened.`{{UDPSocketOpenInfo/writable}}`.`{{WritableStream/abort()}} in order to
          clear any buffered data. If the application has called
          `opened.`{{UDPSocketOpenInfo/readable}}`.`{{ReadableStream/getReader()}} or
          `opened.`{{UDPSocketOpenInfo/writable}}`.`{{WritableStream/getWriter()}} the stream
          is locked and the socket cannot be closed. This forces the developer to
          decide how to handle any read or write operations that are in progress.

          For example, to ensure that all buffered data has been transmitted before
          the socket is closed the application must await the {{Promise}} returned by
          `writer.`{{WritableStreamDefaultWriter/close()}}.

        <pre class="js">
          const encoder = new TextEncoder();
          const { writable } = await socket.opened;
          const writer = writable.getWriter();

          const message = {
            data: encoder.encode("A long message that will take...")
          };

          writer.write(message);
          await writer.close();
          await socket.close();
        </pre>

        To discard any unsent data the application could instead call
        `writer.`{{WritableStreamDefaultWriter/abort()}}.

        If a loop is being used to read data from the socket, then it must be exited before calling
        `socket`.{{UDPSocket/close()}}.

        <pre class="js">
          const { readable } = await socket.opened;
          const reader = readable.getReader();

          async function readUntilClosed() {
            while (true) {
              const { value, done } = await reader.read();
              if (done) {
                // |reader| has been canceled.
                break;
              }
              const { data } = value;
              // Do something with |data|...
            }

            await socket.close();
          }

          const readComplete = readUntilClosed();

          // Sometime later...
          reader.releaseLock();
          await readComplete;
